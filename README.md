# 🚀 End-to-End DevOps Project: Cloud-Native Flask Application

## 📖 Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete DevOps lifecycle for a simple Python web application. The goal is to move from manual deployment to a fully automated **CI/CD pipeline** using modern cloud-native tools.

I am building this project to master the following skills:
- **Containerization** (Docker)
- **Infrastructure as Code** (Terraform)
- **Container Orchestration** (Kubernetes/K3s)
- **Automated Deployment** (GitHub Actions / CI/CD)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Application:** Python (Flask)
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Infrastructure:** AWS (EC2)
- **IaC:** Terraform
- **Orchestration:** Kubernetes (K3s)

## 🗺️ Project Roadmap
This repository is being built in phases.

- [x] **Phase 1: Application Development** (Create simple Flask App)
- [ ] **Phase 2: Dockerization** (Create Dockerfile & Optimize Image)
- [ ] **Phase 3: Infrastructure as Code** (Provision EC2 with Terraform)
- [ ] **Phase 4: Orchestration** (Deploy on Kubernetes)
- [ ] **Phase 5: CI/CD Pipeline** (Automate with GitHub Actions)
